# Ollama Conversational Tools Project

This project utilizes the Ollama library to create an interactive chatbot that can perform various tasks using Python functions as tools. The chatbot can maintain a conversation and respond to user queries using mathematical functions, random number generation, quote generation, and more.

## Features

- **Addition Function**: Performs addition of two numbers.
- **HTTP Request**: Fetches the content of a webpage using the `requests` library.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- **Ollama**: This project requires the Ollama library, which must be running locally. Follow the [official installation guide](https://ollama.com/docs/getting-started) to set it up.

4. Interact with the chatbot by typing your queries, such as:
